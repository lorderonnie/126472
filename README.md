# 126470
This is my main IS PROJECT repository for my Blur project
This task is meant to introduce the student (Ronald Mwambia 126470) to the working basics of the Git Source Versioning
Ecosystem. It will introduce (through practical) the working of the git tool, the online GitHub
repository management system, and how to synchronize the codebase between the two.
